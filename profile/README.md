Hey there! Are you a Kubernetes enthusiast looking for a lightweight application to manage add-ons in hundreds of clusters? Look no further than Sveltos!

Sveltos is a powerful open source project that makes managing Kubernetes add-ons a breeze. It automatically discovers [ClusterAPI](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api) powered clusters and allows you to easily register any other cluster (like GKE). Then, it seamlessly manages Kubernetes add-ons across all your clusters.

But that's not all! Sveltos comes loaded with features like event-driven add-on deployment (using Lua scripts), configuration drift detection, and multi-tenancy to easily manage permissions for tenant admins. You can even preview changes with a dry run and rollback configurations with ease.

And let's not forget about the documentation! Head over to [projectsveltos.io](http://projectsveltos.io/) for the full scoop. 

And if you love Sveltos as much as we do, [give us](https://github.com/projectsveltos/sveltos-manager) a [:star:](https://github.com/projectsveltos/sveltos-manager). 
Your support means a lot to us. **Thank you üôè.**

## Features List

1. Kubernetes [add-on distribution](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/addons/) across multiple clusters;
2. Addons can be represented as [templates](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/template/) and instantiated using values from management cluster resources. Sveltos can fetch any resource in the management cluster provided that the appropriate RBAC permissions are granted;
3. [Event driven framework](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/addon_event_deployment/) to deploy add-ons as response to events in managed clusters. Event can be defined in the form of Lua script;
4. Sveltos' event driven framework can also be configured for [cross-cluster configuration](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/addon_event_deployment/#cross-clusters);
5. [Sveltos extensions](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/extensions/) expand Sveltos by incorporating your own controller to dynamically generate the necessary information required for deploying addons via an automated process;
6. [Configuration drift detection](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/configuration_drift/);
7. [Dry run](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/configuration/#dryrun-mode) to preview effect of a change;
8. [Notification](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/notifications): Sveltos can be configured to send notifications (Kubernetes event and Slack, Webex messages) when for instance all add-ons are deployed in a cluster;
9. Kubernetes [cluster classification](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/labels_management/) and automatic label management based on cluster runtime states;
10. [Multi-tenancy](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/multi-tenancy/) allowing platform admin to easily grant permissions to tenant admins and have Sveltos enforces those;
11. [Techsupport](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/techsupport/): collect tech support from managed clusters;
12. Configuration [snapshots, diff and rollback](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/snapshot/): freeze your policy configurations in time, compare changes between snapshots, and roll back or forward to any saved snapshot.

## Add-ons deployment

The idea is simple:
1. from the management cluster, selects one or more `clusters` with a Kubernetes [label selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors);
2. lists which Kubernetes add-ons need to be deployed on such clusters.

## Template

Values can be passed to helm charts. Sveltos can also fetch needed values from Kubernetes instances present in the management cluster.
For instance following ClusterProfile is reading pod CIDRs from CAPI Cluster instance.

## Snapshot and configuration diff
Take configuration snapshots and display diff

## Event driven framework

Sveltos supports defining an event using Lua. Sveltos can be instructed to deploy add-ons when an event happens in any of the managed cluster.

In this example an event is defined as creation/deletion of a Service instance in certain managed cluster. When an instance of such event happens, Sveltos is instructed to create a NetworkPolicy opening traffic to that service.

## Event driven framework: cross cluster configuration

With Sveltos' event-driven framework, your add-ons will be automatically deployed to the same cluster where the event is detected, allowing for quick and easy deployment. But that's not all - Sveltos can also be configured for cross-cluster configuration, so you can watch for events in one cluster and deploy add-ons to a set of different clusters. With Sveltos, managing add-ons in Kubernetes has never been easier!

## Configuration Drift Detection
Sveltos can automatically detect drift detection between the desired state, defined in the management cluster, and actual state of your clusters and recover from it.

## Cluster classification

Sveltos Classifier is an optional component of the Sveltos project and it is used to dynamically classify a cluster based on its runtime configuration (Kubernetes version, deployed resources and more).

Classifier currently supports the following classification criterias:
1. Kubernetes version
2. Kubernetes resources

## Multi-tenancy

Sveltos provides platform admin with an easy way to grant permissions to tenant admins. Tenant admins can then use Sveltos to deploy tenant applications.

## Sveltos Extensions

When you must dynamically produce information before deploying addons, create your own controller and integrate it with Sveltos.
