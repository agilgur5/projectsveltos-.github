ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to our project! Our [documentation](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/) can help you get started and provides lots of in-depth information.

## âœ¨ What is the Projectsveltos?

Sveltos Kubernetes add-on controller simplifies the deployment and management of add-ons across numerous Kubernetes clusters. It offers support for Helm charts, YAMLs, and Kustomize. With Sveltos, automating the add-on deployment process becomes effortless, ensuring consistency throughout your cluster environments. Additionally, Sveltos provides a solution for platform admins to easily manage permissions for tenant admins, thereby facilitating multi-tenancy.

## Features

* Deploy Kubernetes [add-ons](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/addons/) across multiple clusters
* ProjectsVeltos has native support for ClusterAPI powered clusters, and can also easily manage any other cluster, such as EKS, GKE, on-prem clusters, etc 
* Support for Helm charts, Kustomize, YAML, [Carvel ytt](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/ytt_extension/) and [Jsonnet](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/jsonnet_extension/)
* Configurable deployment strategies
* Automatic rollbacks
* Create [templates](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/template/) to express add-ons
* Use templates to instantiate add-ons from management cluster values
* [Addon Constraints](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/addon_constraint/)
* Enforce constraints when deploying add-ons
* Deploy add-ons in response to events
* Define events in [Lua scripts](https://github.com/projectsveltos/sveltos/blob/main/docs/addon_event_deployment.md#event-definition)
* Framework for [cross-cluster configuration](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/addon_event_deployment/#cross-clusters)

## Add-ons deployment

1. from the management cluster, selects one or more `clusters` with a Kubernetes [label selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors);
2. lists which Kubernetes add-ons need to be deployed on such clusters.

## Add-on compliance

 Use OpenAPI or Lua to define configuration add-on compliances. Let Sveltos enforces those.

## Event driven framework

Sveltos supports defining an event using Lua. Sveltos can be instructed to deploy add-ons when an event happens in any of the managed cluster.
In this example an event is defined as creation/deletion of a Service instance in certain managed cluster. When an instance of such event happens, Sveltos is instructed to create a NetworkPolicy opening traffic to that service.

## Event driven framework: cross cluster configuration

With Sveltos' event-driven framework, your add-ons will be automatically deployed to the same cluster where the event is detected, allowing for quick and easy deployment. But that's not all - Sveltos can also be configured for cross-cluster configuration, so you can watch for events in one cluster and deploy add-ons to a set of different clusters. With Sveltos, managing add-ons in Kubernetes has never been easier!

## Configuration Drift Detection
Sveltos can automatically detect drift detection between the desired state, defined in the management cluster, and actual state of your clusters and recover from it.

## Cluster classification

Sveltos Classifier is an optional component of the Sveltos project and it is used to dynamically classify a cluster based on its runtime configuration (Kubernetes version, deployed resources and more).

Classifier currently supports the following classification criterias:
1. Kubernetes version
2. Kubernetes resources
